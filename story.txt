There I was, hanging upside down by my ankles in the middle of Marienplatz wearing nothing but my Lederhose.
"Ach, du lieber, not again!" I shouted as I tried to remember the previous Nacht.
Looking around I saw an extra large Dirndl on the ground next to me.
I looked to the left of the dirndl, saw a raketenrucksack, and flew off.
I also noticed RyeBrot crumbs still clinging to my beard.
I landed at the nearest Flughafen, hoping the crumbs didn't qualify as FOD on the airfield.
As I walked into the Flughafen, I pulled a Bratwurst out of my pocket and started munching.
However that was not satisfying my hunger. I need a doner!
So I rent out an Audi station wagon and head out to Berlin.
I arrived and saw the mayor there to greet me and a band was playing Rammstein's musik.
The mayor offered me a bratwurst and a hefeweizen to enjoy, then I understood why Dr. Mehlhase classes were awesome.
Because Deutschland is awesome!
While this story is not as awesome as Deutchland, I must say this story is unglaublich. 
I woke up from the absurd dream and went to the Bakerei for Gabaeck.
